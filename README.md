# Trustify

Trustify is an innovative platform designed to build trust among users by leveraging the concept of contacts of contacts. This trust-based mechanism ensures that users can buy products from interlinked personnel with confidence, knowing the product's authenticity is upheld by trusted relationships.

---

## Features
- **Trust Through Connections:** Users are represented as nodes in a Neo4j database, and their relationships (contacts of contacts) form links that foster trust.
- **Verified Transactions:** The trust network ensures that products are delivered as promised.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Powered by Next.js, the frontend offers a seamless user experience.
- **Robust Backend:** The Express-based backend ensures scalability and reliability.

3. **Product Listings:** Users can list products for sale, visible to their trusted network.
4. **Purchases:** Buyers can purchase items from trusted sellers within the network, ensuring authenticity and reliability.
5. **Graph Representation:** Neo4j visualizes these connections, making it easy to understand the trust network.
